### Chef Workstation Installation
Many developers use Chef Management Console in this process. This will make your process easier and you will get a webui but it is a Featured Component. If you want to use Chef Management Console then you can use 25 nodes for free and to use more than 25 nodes, you will have to purchase license.I am not going to use Chef Management Console in my process.
